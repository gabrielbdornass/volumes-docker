The original distribution site of the font files is
<http://www.artifex.com/downloads/>.

The fonts are accompanied by the TeX font metrics, virtual
fonts, font definition and font mapping files to use them
with the LaTeX typesetting system on the PC or Un*x
platform.  The layout of the distribution and the related
installation instructions suit recent, TDS-compliant TeX
systems, particularly teTeX, MikTeX and VTeX/Free.



Installation paths
------------------
The files of your TeX system are arranged in one or more
tree structures, the so-called "texmf trees".  The names and
paths of the particular root directories of these trees vary
between different TeX systems.  In the following
instructions the install paths are indicated in a form such
as, for instance:

  <texmf>/fonts/type1/...
 
<texmf> stands for the the actual name of the root directory
of the texmf tree, where you want to install the files:  

teTeX and MikTeX require additional files to be installed in
a particular "local" tree (rather than in the one where the
default components of the TeX system reside).  Its path must
either be indicated in the documentation of the TeX system
or you should have defined it yourself upon installation.
With MikTeX, for instance, the root directory of the "local"
texmf tree is usually "c:\localtexmf", so you would in fact
have to substitute

  c:\localtexmf\fonts\type1\...
 
for the path name in the above example.  

VTeX/Free, in contrast, has only one single texmf tree,
whose root directory is normally "/usr/local/vtex/texmf" (on
Linux) or "c:\texmf" (on OS/2).

Note that paths are indicated in "Unix notation" (i.e.,
using slashes as directory separators), unless they are
specific for Win or OS/2.



Installing the Type1 font files
-------------------------------
The Type1 font files

  ua1b8a.pfb
  ua1bi8a.pfb
  ua1r8a.pfb
  ua1ri8a.pfb

are to be copied to the directory

  <texmf>/fonts/type1/urw/arial

and the corresponding .afm files should go into

  <texmf>/fonts/afm/urw/arial

Most likely, you will have to create these directories
first.

Feel free to use the fonts also with applications other than
TeX!  The related PFM files are provided for this purpose;
move them to the same directory as the PFBs.



Installing the TeX support files from the archive ua1.zip
---------------------------------------------------------
Unpack the ZIP archive ua1.zip in the directory <texmf>,
i.e., in root directory of the TeX file tree, where you want
to install the present collection.  Thus, all files will end
up in the appropriate directories.



Updating the filename database
------------------------------
Many TeX systems require manual updating of a "filename
database" after adding of new files.  Please, consult the
documentation of your TeX system!



Configuring your TeX system
---------------------------
The present distribution includes several font map files for
the URW Arial fonts.  You need to configure your TeX system
so that an appropriate file will be used in fact.  

The required steps depend on the particular TeX system.
Particular sets of instructions are provided below for the
following systems:

  * MikTeX 2.4 and later
  * VTeX/Free 8 and later

With other TeX systems such a tTeX/TeXLive, consult the
related documentation how to install an additional font map
file.  The name of the map file to be used for Arial is
"ua1.map".  Two identical copies of this file reside
in the directories <texmf>/dvips/config and
<texmf>/fonts/map/dvips/ua1.


* Configuring MikTeX 2.4+
Edit the file <texmf>\miktex\config\updmap.cfg.  (In case it
does not yet exist, create it as a new file.)  Add the line

  Map ua1.map 
  
and save the file; then execute the following commands 
in a command line window ("DOS shell"):

  initexmf -u 
  updmap 


* Configuring VTeX/Free 8+
Make VTeX read the additional font mapping file
ua1.ali.  This is usually accomplished by putting an
appropriate record into each of the configuration files

  <texmf>/vtex/config/pdf.fm
and
  <texmf>/vtex/config/ps.fm

Edit these files; in each file add "ua1.ali"
to the TYPE1 section:

  TYPE1 {
    ...
    ua1.ali
    }
  


Using the URW Arial fonts with LaTeX
----------------------------------------------
See the file arial.txt, which resides in the directory
<texmf>/doc/fonts/urw.



Fontinst sources
----------------
The archive file ua1fnst.zip contains the Fontinst script
and additional mtx files which were used to create the font
metrics and virtual fonts for URW Arial.  You need not
install this material, if you just want to _use_ the fonts
with TeX.
